Why am I getting an "Invalid or non-existent authentication information." error when uploading files?
Ensure that your API Token is valid and has not been revoked.
Ensure that your API Token is properly formatted and does not contain any trailing characters such as newlines.
Ensure that the username you are using is __token__.
Remember that PyPI and TestPyPI each require you to create an account, so your credentials may be different.

If you're using Windows and trying to paste your token in the Command Prompt or PowerShell, note that Ctrl-V and Shift+Insert won't work. Instead, you can use "Edit > Paste" from the window menu, or enable "Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste" in "Properties". This is a known issue with Python's getpass module.
