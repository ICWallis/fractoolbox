    Simple integration model that uses single average density and 
    returns Sv for the observation depth or list of depths.

    Args:
        maxdepth (float): The maximum depth of the stress model [m]
        obsdepth (float or list of floats): Depth(s) where Sv will be returned [m]
        density (float): average rock density [kg/m3] which is typically 2200 - 2800
        All args accept float or integer values

    Returns:
