# Geometric Sample Bias: Isogenic Contours
# ========================================
'''
Seminal work by Terzaghi (1965) revealed a geometric bias generated 
by sampling a three-dimensional fracture network with a line. 
Simply put, fractures planes that are perpendicular to the line are 
very likely to be intersected whereas those parallel to the line are 
almost never intersected. This geometric sample bias generates a 'blind
zone' in fracture datasets where those which are near-parallel to the
scan-line or well-path are rarely sampled. This blind zone is 
sometimes also referred to as the 'well shadow'.

Terzaghi (1965) proposed a methodology quantifies the geometric sample 
bias using the acute angle (alpha) between the fracture plane and 
the line. Visualising the blind zone (where sin(alpha) +/- 0.3) and 
contours of sample bias (isogenic contours) on a stereonet enables
us to visually evaluate the degree that geometric sample bias in 
affects a fracture dataset.  

A weighting may be applied based on the alpha angle which may correct
the sampled fracture population to something more reflective of actual
frequency. This kind of correction is common-place in modern image log
analysis and some form of the Terzaghi correction comes baked into 
most log analysis software. However, there are two key issues with these
corrections:

-   Correction may mislead interpretation by emphasising solitary 
    fractures that are not part of some significant but under-sampled 
    population, especially where the weighting factor approaches 
    infinity near sin α = 0. Priest (1993) recommends resolving this 
    by using an upper limit of sin α = 0.1 when weighting.

-   Correction can only be applied to those fractures which were sampled
    and therefore does a poor job of correcting in the blind zone where
    fractures are rarely sampled. 

Functions are included below that (1) weight fracture populations to 
reduce the impact of geometric sample bias and (2) construct isogenic 
contours for stereonets so the effect of sample bias and the blind 
zone are visible to the interpreter. Refer to Wallis et al. (2020)
for examples of these methods as applied micro-resistivity image 
logs acquired in seven high-temperature geothermal wells.

Refer to geometric-sample-bias.ipynb for an illustration of the 
alpha angles, code examples using the functions, and plots that show
the impact of the blind zone on a range of well data.

# The geometry in these unit vector functions are adapted from 
# Priest (1993) to make the isogenic contours method work. The
# difference is probably abstraction issue where Preist uses 
# the pole (plane normal) throughout his book and I default to 
# dip-azimuth and well-azimuth, as is typical in borehole 
# analysis. I may at some point refactor the isogenic contour 
# method and change these vector functions.

def isogeniccontour(wpl, waz, sin_al):
    '''
    Parametrically calculates isogenic contours based on well path

    Args:
        wpl: Well plunge (0-90 degrees) which is the inclination of the
            well path measured from a horizontal surface
            
            Suggestion: If the well deviation is relativity consistent, 
                calculate the mean deviation magnitude (drillers dip) and 
                subtract this angle from 90 to find the plunge. If there
                are large variations in well geometry, then fracture data
                may need to be split onto separate stereonets, each with a
                set of isogenic contours calculated using that section's 
                mean well deviation. 

        waz: Well azimuth (0-360 degrees) which is the map direction
            the well is deviated in

            Suggestion: If the well azimuth is relativity consistent,
                calculate the mean azimuth. If there are large variations
                in well geometry, then proceeded as per suggestion made 
                above for varying well plunge.

        sin_al: Sin(alpha) (0.01 - 1) which is the contour intervals
            that will ascribe on the stereonet the likelihood a 
            fracture will be sampled

            Suggestion: a float at 0.1 increments from 0.1 to 0.9

    Returns: 
        strike: Strike azimuth (0-360 degrees) based on the right hand rule
        
        dip: Dip magnitude (0-90 degrees)
