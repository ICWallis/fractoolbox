# fractoolbox
Python tools for structural geology and borehole image analysis that includes data handling, frequency and geometric analysis, and reservoir geomechanics.  

fractoolbox is in rapid development so the content of this repo will change regularly and may not be stable. We welcome use of the fractoolbox libraries and notebooks but only on an 'as is' basis and without any warranty implied. 

The juypter notebooks are step-by-step walkthroughs of fractoolbox and other related libraries (such as mplstereonet). Some also describe the theory underlying the tools and point readers to relevant academic literature. If you are new to fractoolbox, these are a good place to start.

Made for Python 3.3+

### New to python? Start here.

If you are new to python, download the introductory Python course for geoscientists from [here](https://github.com/ddempsey/python_for_geoscientists) because it includes a quick-start guide and will set you on the pythonic path.  

We recommend starting by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage python and Juypter notebook installation because it comes with many of packages fractoolbox requires.  

The mplstereonet library is used in fractoolbox for geometric analysis and will need to be installed separately after you have installed Anaconda. Refer to https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet for installation instructions.

### Quick Start Guide

### Development

To date, the content of fractoolbox has been generated during doctoral research undertaken by Irene Wallis, which is supervised by David Dempsey and Julie Rowland (JR) and includes code/math contributions from Evert Durán. The paper below illustrates use of these tools to interpret borehole image data acquired in high-temperature geothermal wells.
